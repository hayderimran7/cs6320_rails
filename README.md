## Overview
This is the project R1 for CS-6320 course taken by me for Spring 2017 under Professor Lynne Grewe.  
I have created this repo to easy access when deploying this rails app on AWS. 

## How to run
### Preferred way (Docker) 

I like to use docker for deploying applications.  
For this make sure you have docker installed.  
Once thats done, run the following script to start the rails app.
```
./run_docker.sh
```
This will start a container named `railsapp` and your app is accessible at 0.0.0.0:3000. 

## Features
Following features are used in this app:

* Ruby on rails

* Sqlite

* Nodejs

* Bootstrap-sass
